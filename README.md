# lsall
A loosely organized collection of various commands to obtain information about a Linux computer.

My hobby is to take discarded computers and install Ubuntu on them, then donate them to underprivileged kids.
I frequently use various lsxxx commands to discover what is in the computer.

This Bash shell script will do all of these information searches in a single script.

# Useage
There is no installation. Just put the script anywhere you wish, make sure it is executable (chmod +x)
Some of the lsxxx commands require that they be run by a sudo user.

sudo ./lsall.sh

The script has been tested on Ubuntu and Raspberry Pi computers.  If you use this script, please provide feedback 
with your experience and suggestions for improvement.
